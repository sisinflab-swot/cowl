// CowlObjectFlags holds information about reference count and object type, while carrying
// an additional boolean flag which can be used by concrete pseudo-classes. Its layout is like this:
//
// |_OTYPE_|B|_______REF_COUNT________|
//
// The reference count field is variably sized, depending on certain preprocessor definitions:
//
// - No definitions (default): 3 bytes
// - COWL_HUGE: 7 bytes
//
// This of course limits the maximum number of references that can be held for any object.
// As of this writing, Cowl does not make any checks about this limit, so one must take
// care not to over-retain objects. Anyway, this is usually not a problem, as the maximum number
// of references is (2^24 - 1), being as big as (2^56 - 1) if COWL_HUGE is defined.
